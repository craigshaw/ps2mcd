  # ps2mcd
ps2mcd is a command line tool that extracts save files from PS2 memory card images, making it easy to back up, transfer or hack your game saves

### Notes
Will work with raw memory card images complete with ECCs (error correction codes) and with memory card images without ECCs, such as those generated by the [8BitMods MemCard PRO2](https://8bitmods.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2-and-ps1-smoke-black/). Have tested with card images generated from this device and those generated by [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/).

Creates a folder in the working directory or at a specified location, named after the provided memory card. All directories and files from the card are then written into this folder.

### Usage Instructions
```bash
usage: ps2mcd.py [-h] [-d DIR] [-l] vmc

positional arguments:
  vmc                Path to PS2 memory card image to be dumped

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         Show help
  -d DIR, --dir DIR  Directory to output dumped files to. If not provided, save files will be extracted to a directory under the working directory with the name of the memory card being dumped
  -l, --list         List files on VMC only, don't dump them to disk
  -v, --version      show program's version number and exit
  ```

### Examples
List the files on the memory card image, `SLUS-21284-1.mc2`
```
$ ./ps2mcd.py -l SLUS-21274-1.mc2
Card: SLUS-21274-1.mc2
Size: 8388608 bytes

```
This command lists all files on the memory card image `SLUS-21284-1.mc2`, displaying each file's size, creation date, last modified date, and file path
***
Dump the files on the memory card image, `Mcd001.ps2`, to a folder under the current directory
```bash
$ ./python.py ps2mcd.py Mcd001.ps2
```
This command extracts all the directories and files from `Mcd001.ps2` and saves them in a new folder named `Mcd001` created under the current working directory.  
***
Dump the files on the memory card image, `MemoryCard1-1.mc2`, to a specific directory
```bash
$ ./python.py ps2mcd.py MemoryCard1-1.mc2 -d ~/Projects/PS2
```
This command extracts all the directories and files from `MemoryCard1-1.mc2` and saves them in a new folder named `~/Projects/PS2/MemoryCard1-1`
